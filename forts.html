It sprawls majestically over a hill 180 m (590.6 ft) in height spread over an area of 280 ha (691.9 acres)
above the plains of the valley drained by the Berach River. The fort precinct with an evocative history is studded with a series of historical palaces, gates, temples and two prominent commemoration towers. 
These monumental ruins have inspired the imagination of tourists and writers for centuries.

Jaisalmer Fort is one of the largest fortifications in the world. It is situated in the city of Jaisalmer,
in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It is a World Heritage Site. It was built in 1156 AD by the Rajput ruler
Rawal Jaisal, from whom it derives its name. (Rawal Jaisal's son was Shalivahan II; Manj and Bhati Rajputs 
are descended from him.) The fort stands amidst the sandy expanse of the great Thar Desert, on Trikuta Hill,
and has been the scene of many battles. Its massive yellow sandstone walls are a tawny lion colour during 
the day, fading to honey-gold as the sun sets, thereby camouflaging the fort in the yellow desert. 
For this reason, it is also known as the Sonar Quila or Golden Fort. The fort is located in the very heart 
of the city, and is one of the most notable monuments in the locality.In 2013, at the 37th session of the 
World Heritage Committee held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Jaisalmer Fort, along with 5 other forts of Rajasthan,
