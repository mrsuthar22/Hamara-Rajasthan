Mount Abu is a popular hill station in the Aravalli Range in Sirohi district of Rajasthan state 
in western India near the border with Gujarat. The mountain forms a distinct rocky plateau 22 km 
long by 9 km wide. The highest peak on the mountain is Guru Shikhar at 1,722 m (5,650 ft) above 
sea level. It is referred to as 'an oasis in the desert' as its heights are home to rivers, 
lakes, waterfalls and evergreen forests. Nearest Railway station is Abu Road Railway station which 
is 27 km away.
The ancient name of Mount Abu is Arbudaanchal. In the Puranas, the region has been referred to as 
Arbudaranya ("forest of Arbhuda") and 'Abu' is a diminutive of this ancient name. It is believed 
that sage Vashistha retired to the southern spur at Mount Abu following his differences with sage 
Vishvamitra. There is another mythology according to which a serpent named "Arbuda" saved the life o
f Nandi - Lord Shiva's bull. The incident happened on the mountain which is currently known as Mount 
Abu and so the mountain is named "Arbudaranya" after that incident which gradually became Abu.
